# Session 2, Week 4 - Arrays

In this week, we'll be going through something that programmers are exposed to on a regular basis: Arrays. Here are some concepts:

- What are Arrays? Some discussion on basic operations you could do
- Scope of testing with Arrays (Well, literally anything under the sun)
- Short discussion on Space efficiency (Array entry swapping)
- How to craft approaches for more difficult problems
