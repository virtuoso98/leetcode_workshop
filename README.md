## :open_file_folder: Navigation 

Each folder contains the code, supplementary material

That being said, I have chosen not to provide slides, relying on the respective **README.md** files each week. If you'd like to get the best experience, I do recommend you come to class as much as possible!

## :books: Resources

If you'd like to go further, here are some resources you can use to up your programming game:

<a href="https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions"> Blind 75 </a> - Essential 75 questions collated by experienced programmers that are frequently tested

<a href="https://techinterviewhandbook.org/introduction">Tech Interview Handbook </a> - A comprehensive guide on how to get into your desired software company from the resume writing, interview process, post-interview and algorithms. 

To be very honest, there is no *one-size-fits-all* guide that'll make you a programming god. In the end, it is about your due diligence in coding regularly. Results will come to fruition if you try.
