# Session 5, Week 7 - Depth-first Search

For DFS and BFS Sessions, we'll be taking a slight detour to a slightly more lecture-heavy session with more content. Depth-first search is a very important concept needed because in some Leetcode questions, you'll be dealing with 2D Data Structures like Binary Trees and Trees. Therefore, a basic understanding of what DFS means is very important. Here is a class summary:

- Study the consturctors of a binary tree
- DFS traversal of a binary tree
- Comparing DFS to a Stack
