    "This notebook contains notes for Depth-First Search (DFS), a very core traversal method in computer science. In general, this algorithm starts off at a root ndoe and explores as far as possible along each branch before performing backtracking (visiting other parts).\n",

    "This is contrasted with breadth-first search, which I will discuss in the next week. For now, this notebook is dedicated to introducing you to DFS in Python. Before Recursion in Python is a little less strict than in OCaml. Therefore, recursive notations can be freely placed anywhere in the code, as long as they make sense. In this notebook, I aim to:\n",

As you have seen from the trace function, it explores from __fac(n)__ to __fac(n-1)__ until it hits the **base case** (The deepest node). While the factorial recursion is 1D in nature, this extends to data structures of further dimensions. \n",
