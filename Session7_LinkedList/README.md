# Session 7, Week 12 - Linked Lists

We're finally at the last week! In this session, I will visit Linked Lists, which is also another topic interviewers love to test. This week's agendas include

- Briefly Introducing Linked List Operations
- Some tips on useful thought processes
- Doing some practice questions with Linked List
- And hopefully, some food to end off this workshop :smiley:

Thank you for staying this far! I hope it was useful for you.
